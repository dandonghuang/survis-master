        "abstract": "This paper presents a methodology called Rigorous Analysis Template Process (RATP) for analysing the behaviours and interactions of multiple components in a Self-Driving Vehicle (SDV) to ensure its system safety, especially when a human driver is involved as a fallback option for handling hazardous events. RATP uses Systems-Theoretic Processes Analysis (STPA) and Event-B formal method to gradually identify safety requirements and build their rigours models. The output of RATP is a set of safety requirements that guide the development of a rigorous model to maintain the system safety against identified hazardous states at different levels of abstraction. The main advantage of RATP is to allow the behaviours of a system to be analysed from a high-abstraction layer to a more detailed concrete layer.",

The weakness in this specification will continue to the next stages, and will result the system failure. Formal methods allow the designer to determine the specifications of the system at different abstraction levels and verify the consistency of this formal specification before it is implemented. This study aimed to build and verify the formal specification of integrated modular avionics ('MA) health monitoring which use the AR'NC-653 standard using a model checking timed automata. The verified results will help developers to define logic effective of fault-tolerance, so as to guarantee the 'MA system can always available.",

        "abstract": "E/E systems have been widely used in safety-critical scenarios in the modern world. The system is composed of a variety of software components in an automobile now, but most of the software vendors only apply the common software process method to construct the software modules. How to avoid the irrational and ambiguous requirements has not been addressed and there is no efficient way to guarantee the correctness of the software components. In this paper, we report a new approach for developing a safety-critical software system. We show how this problem is attacked by adding or improving two software development phases on the traditional software process. Formal specification and verification techniques are employed to establish the new software development methodology. Our new approach has been applied on the verification of an OSEK/VDX standard based real-time OS and the result is encouraging.",

        "abstract": "The integration of formal methods and requirements analysis increases the dependability of safety-critical systems. However it is still very difficult to obtain all of the safety requirements in practice, and formally construct the safety requirements model as well. In this paper, we propose an approach to capture safety requirements and formally describe them by classifying and developing safety requirements specification patterns. Our classification is a result of extracting safety properties from a variety of sources, such as interlocking tables and existing safety relevant functional requirements of railway interlocking system. They contain safety properties at analysis level and design level respectively. Furthermore, safety specification patterns based on the classification are used to formally describe and organize the safety requirements for formal verification. Finally, a tool called SRSV has been developed to enhance the process from deriving safety requirements to verifying. We applied it to the interlocking system at Mohe station in China, and the generated safety properties were then checked to hold by the verification tool.",

        "abstract": "The paper presents a formal specification in the Z notation for a safety-critical control system. It describes a particular medical device but is quite generic and should be widely applicable. The specification emphasizes safety interlocking and other discontinuous features that are not considered in classical control theory. A method for calculating interlock conditions for particular operations from system safety assertions is proposed; it is similar to ordinary Z precondition calculation, but usually results in stronger preconditions. The specification is presented as a partially complete framework that can be edited and filled in with the specific features of a particular control system. Our system is large but the specification is concise. It is built up from components, subsystems, conditions and modes that are developed separately, but also accounts for behaviors that emerge at the system level. The specification illustrates several useful idioms of the Z notation, and demonstrates that an object-oriented specification style can be expressed in ordinary Z.",

To remove difficulties from this type of system better and advanced methodologies are required. This paper presents the use of Z-specification to specify the safety properties of the train system. The paper provides division of railway track into sectors and further division into segments. For the safety of the train a safe distance (open block) is associated with trains to avoid collision. Furthermore, this work uses the circular block around the crossing region. The circular block changes its state from green to red whenever it becomes occupied. Moreover the paper also specifies the safety of trains along the linear motion. This work uses the approach of promotion, which provides relation from local to global system. The authors take train as local system and relate it to the whole system through the operation of promotion. The paper also shows how formal methods are used to specify industrial application successfully.",

The most important requirement of the system is to keep it fault free. This will be possible if the system is subject to development and verification in a systematic approach. Formal specification methods, as the name suggests, are truly formal with a strong mathematical background that can be trusted to facilitate the development of fault-free systems. The paper will discuss examples of safety-critical systems and some common type of errors that are found in the development of such systems will be discussed. The paper will examine how different domains affect the standards of formal specification methods in different applications. The approach will be to survey various papers in the related fields.",

        "abstract": "Micro-controller units (MCUs) implement the de facto interface between the physical and digital worlds. As a consequence, they appear in a variety of sensing/actuation applications from smart personal spaces to complex industrial control systems and safety-critical medical equipment. While many of these devices perform safety- and time-critical tasks, they often lack support for security features compatible with their importance to overall system functions. This lack of architectural support leaves them vulnerable to run-time attacks that can remotely alter their intended behavior, with potentially catastrophic consequences. In particular, we note that, MCU software often includes untrusted third-party libraries (some of them closed-source) that are blindly used within MCU programs, without proper isolation from the rest of the system. In turn, a single vulnerability (or intentional backdoor) in one such third-party software can often compromise the entire MCU software state. In this article, we tackle this problem by proposing, demonstrating security, and formally verifying the implementation of UCCA: an Untrusted Code Compartment Architecture. UCCA provides flexible hardware-enforced isolation of untrusted code sections (e.g., third-party software modules) in resource-constrained and time-critical MCUs. To demonstrate UCCA\u2019s practicality, we implement an open-source version of the design on a real resource-constrained MCU: the well-known TI MSP430. Our evaluation shows that UCCA incurs little overhead and is affordable even to lowest-end MCUs, requiring significantly less overhead and assumptions than the prior related work.",
